This code was created to implement a yearly message to remind users to make donations in time before the end of the year. The messaging shouldn't change much so I made that content available in the message.json file. The current, and next year updates automatically while the messaging itself is hidden depending on if it falls within a date range.

This script is intended to be added to a content spot within Blackbaud. It could be forked to serve other purposes though.
